As the Star Citizen community eagerly anticipates the upcoming Alien Week 2953, speculation is mounting about potential new ship releases. One ship that's been generating a buzz is the Banu Triptaker. Based on details gleaned from the recent ["A Gift from Baba Part 3"](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/serialized-fiction/18353-A-Gift-For-Baba-Part-3) story, this ship could be a fascinating addition to the Star Citizen universe. Here's what we know so far and why it might be unveiled during the event.

## The Triptaker: A Glimpse into Banu Craftsmanship

The Triptaker, as described in the story, is a ship of approximately Constellation size, featuring a vertical-style docking port. This design choice creates an immersive climbing entrance experience into the main chamber, a departure from the conventional horizontal docking ports.

Once inside, the Triptaker reveals its true grandeur. The main chamber is a testament to the intricate and detailed craftsmanship of the Banu. Bathed in warm lighting, the room showcases a patchwork of different materials and patterns along the curving, sweeping walls, culminating in a high pointed arch. The forward end of this chamber boasts a lavish table surrounded by thick cushions, creating an atmosphere of luxury and comfort. The chamber also houses a collection of small, rare items, hinting at the ship's potential for trade and display.

## Why the Triptaker Might Be Released Soon

The recent release of information about the Triptaker in the "A Gift from Baba Part 3" story suggests that the ship might be closer to release than we think. The Triptaker's medium size and the existing Banu assets from the Merchantman and Defender could potentially expedite its development, especially if the ship's design centers around a trading and display room that use the majority of its space.

In the [Star Citizen Live: Invictus All-Vehicles Roundtable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSM8kao5Q6k) , I just felt that they 

With several unannounced ships in the works, the Triptaker could very well be one of them.

## Speculating on the Price and the 'Alien Tax'

If the Triptaker were to be released, I would venture a guess that it might be priced around $350, or $300 if only concepted. While the 'alien tax' often inflates the price of alien ships, the Triptaker might be an exception. Most alien ships are also dedicated fighters, attracting both the alien tax and the dedicated fighter tax. However, the Triptaker, like the relatively affordable Railen, is not a dedicated fighter, which could make it a more budget-friendly option for an alien ship.

As we approach Alien Week 2953, the Triptaker remains an exciting possibility. Only time will tell if this intriguing ship will make its debut during the event. Stay tuned for more
