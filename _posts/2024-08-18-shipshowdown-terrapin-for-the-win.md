## 2954 Ship Showdown: Terrapin for the win!

The Terrapin is the best ship for the 2954 Ship Showdown! The biggest reason is it has been teasing all of us each year till now!   I believe it should at least get a top 4 but would prefer it win over all!

My number one reason for trying to convince ya all it should win is that if it wins it will get its first skin!  I believe with a win it may also bump up CIG's priority list a tiny bit.  Also Unlike the ship it will be competing vs the next round, the Terrapin seems downright affordable compared to the 600i Explorer for the average gamer both in game and in our web hangers!(if 220usd can be considered affordable! I don't have one yet for sure!).  

### Good things come to those who vote 'Terrapin'??
/start conspiracy theory 
Honestly a very small thought of mine is that they have been holding off on making the Terrapin gold standard as well as variations until it wins a top 4 or over all Ship Showdown event.  If the Terrapin wins, it should have spiked sales, and reaffirm in CIG's eyes and wallets that the Terrapin can be a money maker for them.  They may even have something ready to go soon after IAE if it wins, or at least a plan to get something on the roadmap related to it.  
/end conspiracy theory.
