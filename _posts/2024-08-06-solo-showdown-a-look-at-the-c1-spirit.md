## Solo Showdown: A look at the C1 Spirit!

The C1 Spirit is a great choice for solo players in Star Citizen. It is a versatile ship that can be used for a variety of purposes, from cargo hauling to mining, bounty hunting to small salvage ops. With its sleek design and powerful engines, easy to use cargo area and loading ramp, the C1 Spirit is a force to be reckoned with in the verse.

Here we can see a C1 with a ROC, a Cyclon, and 32 SCU of cargo space. Clearly it allows you to do cargo missions while also being prepared to do some mining or ground vehicle missions as well if the situation arises!

## Why the C1 Spirit is a great choice for solo players

This ship is easy to solo, the tractor beam need you to swap seats, but that is the only system you can not easily access as a solo player.  The ship is fast and fun and great looking! I think it will allow most people to figure out what game play loop they will enjoy in short order and is a great step up from the starter ships!
