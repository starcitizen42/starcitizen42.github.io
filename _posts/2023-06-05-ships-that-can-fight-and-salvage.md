Thanks for checking my site out!  I was thinking that with the way salvage is working in game, ships with easy to access cargo, a second entrance so you can pack that cargo full of Kraken summoning piles of weapons, and soon ships that have a tractor beam like the Cutty Black.  These ships will be of greater use with the current meta imho.

So with out further blathering on my part.  Here is the list of ships that I think will be good for fighting and salvaging.

1. **Nomad** - This ship is one of the best solo ships for fighting and salvaging.  It has a rear bed that can be used to store lots of salvaged materials.  It also has a remote tractor turret right above the bed that the pilot should be able to operate with out ever even leaving his seat!  I feel that this is the current best solo player pick for a fighting and salvaging ship.

2. **Cutlass series** - This ship is a great all around ship.  Some of this series has a tractor beam, multiple entrances, and a decent amount of cargo space.  It also has a turret that can be used by a second player.  I feel this is a good simple pick for a team effort.

3. **Freelancer series** - This ship is a great all around ship. it has a rear cargo door as well as a second entrance on the side of the ship that is removed from the cargo area, and a decent amount of cargo space.  It also has a turret that can be used by a second player.  It is a great ship for fighting and salvaging.

4. **Constellation series** - This ship is a great all around ship.  It has a tractor beam, a second entrance, and a decent amount of cargo space.  It also has a turret that can be used by a second player.  It is a great ship for fighting and salvaging.

5. **Spirit C1** - this ship is nice cause it has a rear entrance with a tractor beam right above it to aid in salvaging.  It also has a decent amount of cargo space.  It is a great ship for fighting and salvaging.
