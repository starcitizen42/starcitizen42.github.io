Thanks for checking my site out!  I was thinking that with the way salvage is working in game, ships with easy to access cargo, a second entrance so you can pack that cargo full of Kraken summoning piles of weapons, and soon ships that have a tractor beam like the Cutty Black.  These ships will be of greater use with the current meta imho.

So with out further blathering on my part.  Here is the list of ships that I think will be good for fighting and salvaging.


***Solo Ships***

[**C.O. Nomad**](/2023/06/05/the-nomad.html) [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Nomad) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/vzs4ydq9) - The Nomad, a true gem among solo ships in Star Citizen, reigns supreme when it comes to combat and salvaging prowess. Its ingenious design incorporates a rear cargo bed, ingeniously tailored to easily accommodate salvaged materials. Furthermore, positioned just above the bed is a remote tractor turret, granting the pilot seamless control without ever having to vacate their seat. This unparalleled combination of functionality and convenience renders the Nomad the undisputed choice for solo players seeking a ship that excels in both combat encounters and resource salvage operations. Elevate your gameplay experience with the Nomad, the epitome of a solo fighter and salvager's dream.

**MISC Reliant Kore** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Reliant_Kore) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/0GoQeiw4) - A versatile ship that seamlessly combines a rear cargo area with the convenience of a built-in tractor beam. Though lacking a second entrance, this vessel compensates with its unparalleled utility. Ensure ample space for ingress and egress when loading salvage. With its unmatched in class cargo-hauling capabilities and the added advantage of a tractor beam, this ship stands as the epitome of efficiency. Embark on your duties with confidence, knowing that the MISC Reliant Kore is the perfect vessel to effortlessly carry out your missions.

**315P** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/315p) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/GQIUsJdQ) - A vessel that combines elegance with functionality. This versatile ship boasts a cargo capacity of 12scu, making it an excellent choice for hauling goods and equipment. However, it's worth noting that effectively utilizing the cargo space may require some finesse and organization because the 315p featured tractor beam, is also in a less conveniently placed position. While it offers valuable utility for interacting with objects and salvaging resources, its placement may require additional effort and maneuvering. Nevertheless, the Origin 315p remains a capable vessel, enabling you to explore the vast reaches of space while leveraging its cargo capabilities and making the most of its tractor beam functionality.

**Avenger Titan** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Nomad) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/hejnO4ub) - This remarkable ship not only combines sleek design with impressive versatility but also offers a unique advantage for salvage operations. With its dedicated cargo hatch in the rear, the Avenger Titan provides a separate entrance, allowing you to load it to the brim with salvaged treasures. While this distinguishes it from other solo ships, it's important to note that harnessing its full potential requires venturing beyond the comfort of your cockpit. Equipped with a multitool, you can easily disembark and load your cargo. However, this may leave you vulnerable to attacks, so it's best to ensure that the area is secure before venturing out. Nevertheless, the Avenger Titan is a formidable ship, offering a unique combination of combat and salvage capabilities.

***Multiplayer ships***

**Drake Cutlass series** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Cutlass_Black) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/n5VNKuR7) - These exceptional ships offer versatility and functionality that cater to a wide range of needs. With the exception of the Steel variant, each ship in this series comes equipped with a handy tractor beam, providing you with the ability to effortlessly interact with objects and salvage valuable resources. Multiple entrances ensure easy access and efficient movement within the ship, while a generous cargo capacity allows you to transport goods and equipment with ease. Additionally, the inclusion of a turret enables a second player to take control, further enhancing your firepower and defense capabilities. With its well-rounded features and team-oriented design, the Cutlass series stands as an excellent choice for collaborative efforts.

**Freelancer series** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Freelancer) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/396nA80J) - A ship that excels in combat and salvage operations. While lacking a tractor beam, the Freelancer compensates with its rear cargo door, providing easy access to load and unload valuable salvage. In addition, a second entrance, removed from the salvage area, ensures convenient mobility within the ship. With a substantial capacity for salvage, the Freelancer allows you to haul a significant amount of salvaged materials to your desired destinations. Equipped with a turret that can be manned by a second player, the Freelancer enhances your combat capabilities and defensive strength during salvage missions.

**Constellation series** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Constellation_Taurus) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/tWSsufy7) - A fleet of exceptional ships that excels in both combat and salvage operations. The Taurus variant, in particular, stands out with its inclusion of a tractor beam, offering unparalleled utility for salvage endeavors. Every ship in the Constellation series features a second entrance, ensuring easy access and efficient movement within the vessel. With a generous cargo capacity, these ships allow you to transport a substantial amount of salvage to maximize your profits. Some are equiped with two turrets that can be manned by a second and third player, the Constellation series amplifies your combat capabilities and defensive strength during intense engagements. As the game loops evolve, the Constellation series remains a reliable choice, adapting seamlessly to new challenges and offering a well-rounded experience for any aspiring spacefarer. Choose the Constellation series and dominate both the salvage and combat fronts with style and efficiency.

**Spirit Series** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/C1_Spirit) - The commendable C1 and A1 models, each excelling in different aspects of gameplay. The C1 proves to be a practical choice for those seeking to combine attacking and salvaging within a single outing. With its rear tractor and strategically positioned cargo bay doors, the C1 offers convenient salvage capabilities alongside its cargo hauling functionality. While it may not hold top-tier status, it provides a reliable option for multi-faceted missions. On the other hand, the A1 shines as a formidable attacker, focusing primarily on offensive capabilities. However, it falls short in dedicated salvage functionality. Both ships lack a separate entrance, limiting their suitability for dedicated salvage or combat endeavors

**Catapillar** [<u>SC Tools</u>](https://starcitizen.tools/Caterpillar) [<u>ERKUL</u>](https://www.erkul.games/loadout/n5VNKuR7) - a ship seemingly designed for salvage enthusiasts seeking maximum efficiency. With not one, but two tractor beams, positioned strategically to access the numerous cargo sections on the hull, the Caterpillar excels in collecting salvage like no other. Its design optimizes the process of gathering valuable resources from the depths of space. Furthermore, the Caterpillar offers ample cargo space, allowing you to store an impressive amount of salvaged materials. To enhance the destructive part of salvaging operations, dedicating some cargo space for small fighters proves to be a wise choice, enabling effective defense and combat support. With its exceptional salvage capabilities and the ability to accommodate auxiliary fighters, the Caterpillar truly shines as the go-to ship for salvage operations. Embark on lucrative ventures, gather precious resources, and unleash the full potential of the Caterpillar as you navigate the depths of the Star Citizen universe.
