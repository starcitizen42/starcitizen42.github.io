## authors note, unedited.  

I am using AI assistance to make my writing and coding better.  I am just using this to help me make a great site, not do all the work for me.  I use it to collect info, that I then cross check my self, and to help me put it in to words and formatting that is more appleaing ( at least to my eyes and brain LOL )  I grew up with dysgraphia and other issues and while I have always enjoyed reading, my output has always suffered.  So please dont critizen me to harshly for using this crutch!

I hope you all enjoy it, and I will have a email address setup as soon as I have a long term plan for this sites existance.

 Thank you all for your time and I hope you enjoy the site!  Please keep it positive!


 P.S. I tend to jump the gun,  if there are clear errors, [Please let me know!](https://github.com/starcitizen42/starcitizen42.github.io/issues/new?title="please replace me with a link to page that has issues"), and keep in mind I may be making edits right after I made a post live,  cause I am just wierd like that. like I think I read something, then notice I blanked on an entire paragraph of nonsense.
