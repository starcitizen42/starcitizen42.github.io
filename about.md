authors note, unedited.  I am using AI assistance to make my writing and coding better.  I am just using this to help me great a site, not do all the work for me.  I use it to collect info, that I then cross check my self, and to help me put it in to words and formatting that is more appleaing ( at least to my eyes and brain LOL )  I grew up with dysgraphia and other issues and while I have always enjoyed reading, my output has always suffered.  So please dont critizen me to harshly for using this crutch!

I hope you all enjoy it, and I will have a email address setup as soon as I have a long term plan for this sites existance.

 Thank you all for your time and I hope you enjoy the site!  Please keep it positive!
